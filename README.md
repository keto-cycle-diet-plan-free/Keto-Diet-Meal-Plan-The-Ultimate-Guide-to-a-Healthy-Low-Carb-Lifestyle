### What is the Keto Diet?
The ketogenic diet, commonly known as the **keto diet**, is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat eating plan that encourages the body to enter a metabolic state called **ketosis**. In ketosis, the body burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates, leading to significant weight loss and other health benefits.
